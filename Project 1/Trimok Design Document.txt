Game Basics

Trimok is played on a 6x6 square board
As denoted below

   	A	B 	C 	D	E	F
1	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]
2	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]
3	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]
4	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]
5	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]
6	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]	[]

There are only 3 kinds of pieces
->3 Stack {3}
->2 Stack {2}
->1 Stack {1}

The starting position of the board is 
[ ] ->denotes an empty space

  	A	B 	C 	D	E	F
1	[3]	[2]	[1]	[3]	[2]	[1] <-Black Side
2	[3]	[2]	[1]	[3]	[2]	[1]
3	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]
4	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]	[ ]
5	[3]	[2]	[1]	[3]	[2]	[1]
6	[3]	[2]	[1]	[3]	[2]	[1] <-White Side

There are 2 sides: White and Black
->For my purposes, White will get the first turn
->A random 50/50 chance will be used to decide who gets to be white

Game Rules
-Each player only gets 1 move per turn.

-Each player can only move 1 piece per turn

-They can only move to adjacent cell or
-A cell occupied by an enemy stack

->Movement rules are: Stacks can Move Up,down,left,right and diagonally

Capture Rules:

->Stacks of size 3 capture stacks of size 2
->Stacks of size 2 capture stacks of size 1
->Stacks of size 1 capture stacks of size 3

Special Move: Return Move

When a piece reaches the first row of its opponent's side, it can move back to its starting row using the Return Move.

So a white stack on row 1 can jump back to row 6 
So a black stack on row 6 can jump back to row 1

There are limitations on this kind of move however.
->It can only jump to an empty cell
->It can only jump to its starting column or an adjacent column

GOAL: To capture all the pieces
->Subgoal -> to create a situation by which the enemy cannot capture any of your pieces.
